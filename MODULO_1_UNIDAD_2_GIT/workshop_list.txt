So, my current plans are:
-Finish nemesis crown before friday of next week.
-Finish Yrellian and Skaw.
-Make this necromantic fellow.
-and then pick one of the 87 things left to do that i said i will do.
-Start to take into consideration not saying yes to every request for character and mod implementation on the game.
